This is an API made for the audition site.

In order to run this API you need to have Python 3.6+ and MySQL server installed on your device. \
Then you have to update the secret.json file with correct values for db connection and 
- run the query in file "database.sql";
- run commmands:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

And supposedly it should run successfully :)
